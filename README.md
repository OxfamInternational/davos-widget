## Local testing

Due to CORS we need to run within a webserver whilst developing locally.

You should be able to run a local server using: `python3 -m http.server`.

Then you can access the test site at http://localhost:8000/

## Troubleshooting

### Uncaught (in promise)

This may just be an issue with the python local server. But confirm this when we integrate into OI (as should go away).
