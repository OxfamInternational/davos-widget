# How to edit the local copy

This change is handy if you want to have different copy on your site compared to the default supplied.

1. Editors will supply the new copy to the local sitesdevelopment team
structured in a similar way to the [json file](https://github.com/OxfamInternational/davos-widget/blob/master/davos-widget.json)
2. Developers will update the local json, and test locally
3. Code will be deployed as per normal deployment workflows.

Note: Ideally this would be limited, as we would like the core application code
to contain most (if not all) variations.
