# How to edit the global copy

This change will be committed to the repo, and will be used as the defaults on
any new sites.

1. Editors will supply the new copy to the OI development team structured in a
similar way to the [json file](https://github.com/OxfamInternational/davos-widget/blob/master/davos-widget.json)
2. Developers will update the json, and test locally
3. Code will be committed and pushed

Note: This will have no instand affect, subsites will need to update their code
accordingly, so will require comms. if that is a requirement.
