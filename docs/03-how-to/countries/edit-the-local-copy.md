# How to edit the local copy

Countries can change copy, but we will not support this, so should be done at the countries own risk. If issues occur, revert the modified json.

Note: This does not include CTAs, which are supported, and documented in our [Edit the local CTAs doc](/docs/03-how-to/countries/edit-the-local-ctas.md)
