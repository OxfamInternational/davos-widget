# Technical Overview

A quick intro as to how the widget works, and introducing a couple of the core features in place.

- js
- css
- json

## Theming

We apply some base css to the theme, with the intention of keeping it so the country developers can overwrite it to align better with their own site where necessary.

## Integration

This is done by adding the css/js/json files, then having a token placed on the page which gets replace by the js with the widget itself.
